# Special lab 1: Text and Pointer: specs

In this lab you need to prompt the user for a string (char \*), and then print its pointer

For example:
<br/>

![The picture contains "---Enter a text then it will print the number and its pointer---Text: h\n The text is h and the pointer is 0x7fffd2f93320\n"](spec-pic.jpg)

The text that you will print after the user has entered a text should be exactly like this:

```
The text is {text} and the pointer is: {pointer}
```
